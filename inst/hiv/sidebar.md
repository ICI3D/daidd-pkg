In this tutorial, we will fit a series of different model structures to HIV prevalence data from antenatal clinics (ANC data). **You should first complete the tutorial using the Harare data. If you have time, you can then repeat the exercise with one of the other datasets.** We will fit the data _by eye_, which is not rigorous, but can be useful for developing intution about the model-fitting.
