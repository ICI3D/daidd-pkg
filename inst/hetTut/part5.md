# Part 5: Heterogeniety & R0

Recall that R0 = beta/gamma.

What about when individuals have different betas? Since we're using gamma = 1, in this model R0 = beta, at least for a homogenous population.

Explore how adding heterogeneity can affect outbreak dynamics when the average R (*i.e.*, the number of infectious contacts each infected person makes) is less than 1 but heterogeneous.
