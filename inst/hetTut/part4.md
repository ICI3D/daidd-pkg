# Part 4: Heterogeneity & R0

Recall that R0 = beta/gamma.

What about when individuals have different betas? Since we're using gamma = 1, in this model R0 = beta, at least for a homogenous population.

Explore how adding heterogeneity can affect outbreak dynamics when the average R (*i.e.*, the number of infectious contacts each infected person makes) is less than 1 but heterogeneous.

In this simulation model the index infection (first infected individual) was chosen at random but proportional to individuals' contact rates such that the first infected individual is more likely to be someone with a higher contact rare.  How do you think this affects the relationship between heterogeneity and the distribution of outbreak sizes?  How might the patterns change if the index infection was chosen at random independent of their contact rate?
