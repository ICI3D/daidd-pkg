# Part 4: Changing Population

Now change the above code so that you have a larger population size. Note that the bigger this is the longer the simulation is going to run, so be careful not to choose anything too big (probably not more than 500 or so).

What happens to the randomness in the simulation as you increase population size. How does this change how different levels of heterogeneity (variance in mixing
rates) affects epidmic dynamics?
